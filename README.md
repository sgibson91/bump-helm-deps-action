# HelmUpgradeBot for Hub23

This is an automatable bot that will check the chart dependencies of the Hub23 Helm chart are up to date with their source.
If a new version is available, the bot will open a Pull Request to the [`alan-turing-institute/hub23-deploy` repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/hub23-deploy) inserting the new chart dependency versions into the Hub23 Helm Chart requirements file.

## :mag: Overview

This is an overview of the steps the bot executes.

- If a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) is not provided as an environment variable, log into Azure and pull one from an Azure Key Vault
  - The login will either be interactively if run locally or via a [Managed System Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) if run from a server.
    The server will require [`GET` permissions to the secrets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/secrets/about-secrets#secret-access-control) stored in the Azure Key Vault.
- Read Hub23's Helm chart requirements file and find the versions of the dependencies
- Scrape the Helm chart source indexes and find the most recent version release for each dependency
- If there is a newer chart version available, then:
  - Fork and clone the [`alan-turing-institute/hub23-deploy`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/hub23-deploy) repository
  - Checkout a new branch
  - Add the new version(s) to the hub23-chart requirements file
  - Stage, commit and push the file to the branch
  - Open a Pull Request to the parent repository
  - Assign labels to the Pull Request if required

A moderator should check and merge the Pull Request as appropriate.

## ðŸ¤” Assumptions HelmUpgradeBot Makes

Here is a list detailing the assumptions that the bot makes.

1. You have a GitHub PAT
   1. It is stored in an Azure Key Vault or provided by the `API_TOKEN` environment variable
2. The configuration for your BinderHub deployment is in a pulic GitHub repository.
3. Your deployment repository contains a local Helm chart with a `requirements.yaml` file.

## :pushpin: Installation and Requirements

To install the bot, you will need to clone this repository and install the package.
It requires Python version >=3.7.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HelmUpgradeBot/hub23-deploy-upgrades.git
cd hub23-deploy-upgrades
python setup.py install
```

You will also need to install the [Microsoft Azure command line interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest).

### :cloud: Install the Azure CLI

To install the Azure command line interface, run the following:

```bash
curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
```

## :children_crossing: Usage

To run the bot, execute the following:

```bash
usage: helm-bot [-h] [-k KEYVAULT] [-n TOKEN_NAME] [-t TARGET_BRANCH]
                [-b BASE_BRANCH] [-l LABELS [LABELS ...]] [--identity]
                [--dry-run] [-v]
                repo_owner repo_name chart_name

Upgrade the Helm Chart of the Hub23 Helm Chart in the hub23-deploy GitHub
repository

positional arguments:
  repo_owner            The GitHub repository owner
  repo_name             The deployment repo name
  chart_name            The name of the local helm chart

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -k KEYVAULT, --keyvault KEYVAULT
                        Name of the Azure Key Vault storing secrets for the
                        BinderHub
  -n TOKEN_NAME, --token-name TOKEN_NAME
                        Name of the bot's access token as stored in the Azure
                        Key Vault
  -t TARGET_BRANCH, --target-branch TARGET_BRANCH
                        The git branch to commit to. Default: helm_chart_bump.
  -b BASE_BRANCH, --base-branch BASE_BRANCH
                        The base branch to open the Pull Request against.
                        Default: main.
  -l LABELS [LABELS ...], --labels LABELS [LABELS ...]
                        List of labels to assign to the Pull Request
  --identity            Login to Azure using a Managed System Identity
  --dry-run             Perform a dry-run helm upgrade
  -v, --verbose         Print output to the console. Default is to write to a
                        log file.
```

Alternatively, the GitHub PAT can be provided directly using the `API_TOKEN` environment variable, like so:

```bash
API_TOKEN="your-token-here" HelmUpgradeBot repo_owner repo_name deployment chart_name [--flags]
```

### :lock: User Permissions

#### GitHub API

When [creating the GitHub API token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token), it will need to be assigned the [`public_repo` and `delete_repo` scopes](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps#available-scopes).

#### Virtual Machine

The user (or machine) running this script will need _at least_ the following permissions for interacting with Azure resources.

- `Contributor` role permissions to the Kubernetes cluster to be upgraded, and
- Permission to get secrets from the Azure Key Vault (`Get` and `List`).

### :clock2: CRON expression

To run this script at 10am daily, use the following cron expression:

```bash
0 10 * * * cd /path/to/hub23-deploy-upgrades && /path/to/python setup.py install && /path/to/HelmUpgradeBot [--flags]
```

### :clapper: GitHub Action

Rather than pay for a Virtual Machine to run the bot, it could be run in a [GitHub Action workflow](.github/workflows/run-bot.yml) instead.
The GitHub API token should be [added to the repository as a secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) named `ACCESS_TOKEN`.

## :white_check_mark: Running Tests

After following the [installation instructions](#pushpin-installation-and-requirements), the test suite can be run as follows:

```bash
python -m pytest -vvv
```

`coverage.py` can also be used to generate a coverage report of the test suite:

```bash
python -m coverage run -m pytest -vvv
coverage report
```

An interactive HTML report can be generated with the command `coverage html` and accessed by opening `htmlcov/index.html` in your browser.
